# Welcome to scanner-kit!

At scanner-kit, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with lightweight document database for prototypes, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[debug-rev-04](https://github.com/scanner-kit/debug-rev-04)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast debug-rev-04 library. ✨

Beyond debug-rev-04, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* automate optimization
* chat integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
